## Checklist for developing a robust eCommerce app

### In-depth Market Research

A thorough analysis of market conditions is of utmost importance in this highly competitive era where several eCommerce apps enter the market almost daily. Market analysis helps to identify the risk factors, plan the development appropriately and spot the business opportunities with ease. During market research, you should study if there is a need for this app in the market or does your idea already exist in the market? If yes, ensure that you have a unique idea and need to understand the Unique Selling Proposition (USP) of your products or services. You also need to research whether you want to create a b2b app like Aliexpress or have a b2c app like Amazon

A few other factors to consider while doing market research, are as follows:

* Target audience and their preferences
* Competitor analysis to get an idea on what are their key features that sets them apart
* Latest trends in the eCommerce sector
* Business strategies and solutions
* Advertising and promotional activities



### Right selection of Platform and Technology Stack

One of the most challenging decisions for an eCommerce app development company is to determine the platform and the technology to be used. It depends on the budget and the business needs to a large extent.

While choosing a platform, one may get tempted to publish the app on various platforms simultaneously, however, without checking whether the app you develop would be accepted by the customers can lead to monetary losses for the businesses. Developing a minimum viable product (MVP) initially for one platform and gradually updating the app on other platforms would rather be a great option. Also, it is necessary to research well and choose the right technology stack for the front-end and back-end development. One should hire well-experienced eCommerce [app developers](https://www.biz4solutions.com/mobile-application-development-company/) after thorough screening.



### Must have Features

* Product List
* Search Bar
* Wishlist
* Buy Now and Add-to-cart Buttons
* Geo-location integration and order tracking functionality
* Push Notifications
* Multiple Payment and Shipping Options
* Review and Ratings
* Social Media Integration
* Business Intelligence Tool



### Simplified Sign-up and Checkout Process

These can become the biggest barriers in the success of your app. So, avoid lengthy or multi-page sign-ups and checkout processes. Make it easier for the users by allowing registration through social media platforms. Provide them the option to use mobile wallet systems or apps for making payments.



### Captivating UI and Responsive Design

The look and feel of the app forms the first impression on your users. So, one should make sure that the User Interface is engaging, has decent color combinations, is easy to navigate through and helps the users to find what they are searching for. The app should look attractive, yet be simple to use. Also, the responsiveness of the app is a crucial factor to consider. The app should be usable on all types of devices and fit their screen dimensions, without affecting the user experience.



### Security

In an eCommerce app, the users need to share their personal and sensitive information like contact details, bank account details, etc. So, security is of utmost importance. The app must use high-level authentication and should be highly secured. It must be protected from any unauthorized access. The data should not be shared with any third-party services. Also, it must have its security policies in place, while uploading the app on Google play store or App store.



### App Optimization

It should be updated with the latest trendy features from time-to-time which effectively should make the navigation much easier. SEO optimization, content marketing, online advertisements, social media marketing are a few other considerations for marketing and optimizing the app.
